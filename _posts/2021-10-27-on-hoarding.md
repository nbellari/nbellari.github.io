## On Hoarding

Hoarding - whether digital or physical - is an addiction. And with any addiction, in general, it gives a dopamine rush at the time of indulgence and leaves us empty afterwards.

We order something on a shopping site in the hope that it will make our life better. That expectation - the good hope - is caused by dopamine rush. Similarly we bookmark a page or download a e-book or a paper in the hope that it will help us learn better and advance our knowledge. Again, instantaneous dopamine rush! But it does not last long. We forget what we ordered and we forget what we downloaded soon, so it just sits there in a big pile of **not to be seen again** things. And life moves on...

Hoarding, since it is a continuous lifelong activity, will also sabotage - whatever limited - time, energy, attention, money that we have in our lives. That which we could have spent on important things - family, work, hobbies etc. is instead spent on a futile activity. 

There is no universal solution to get away from the bad habits that we have. Each one of us pick up bad habits in different contexts and what works for some may not work for other. In this sense, the self-help guide to a person is him/herself. Only by properly understanding oneself better, will s/he be able to find ways to get out of bad habits. And yes, I think, there is a universal way to properly understand oneself better - meditation!
