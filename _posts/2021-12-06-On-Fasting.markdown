I think that modern medicine looks at the human body in a reductionist fashion (break the body into smaller parts until you hit a cell, then reason about the body based on those fundamental elements), while ancient medicine looks at the body rather holistically (talk about energy centres and the role they play and how to nurture them etc.). To me, the latter is a rather interesting perspective on things.

It is believed that _**Prana**_ (some higher form of energy that runs through the body) is capable of running the systems inside us. But it can run only one system at a time. For example, when we have food, _**Prana**_ gets busy in digesting the food. However, digesting takes quite some amount of time, actually. It can take upto 6 hrs to completely digest whatever we eat. Of course, the other thing that _**Prana**_ does is heal our body, get rid of toxins etc. Now, if we are always eating, cramming things inside the stomach, then _**Prana**_ gets busy with just digesting the stuff and never gets time to heal our body!

That is where fasting plays a vital role. By fasting, what we are doing essentially is that we give _**Prana**_ some space to focus on something other than digesting food - healing. That is why intermittent fasting or complete fasting plays a vital role in fixing the body. The more we eat, the more sick we get.

And fasting does not just apply to the body. It applies to the mind as well. Our minds are always chatting with ourselves. We need to fast our minds so that it can get the necessary space to heal itself and the body.  And meditation is the mechanism with which we fast our minds!!

So, fast your body and mind and be healthy!
