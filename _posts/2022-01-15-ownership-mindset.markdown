The ownership mindset is a very important attitude. That is what makes one do a given tak with utmost commitment of energy and focus. Attachment to a task at hand, being emotionally tied to a task at hand is quint-essential to getting it done satisfactorily. One cannot have a detached attitude towards things - "this is not something I want to do", "I hate this thing", "I am not supposed to be doing this", "I am supposed to be doing something else right now" - all these thoughts will create a very miserable situation for us - we can not be in the present, we can not enoy it, we can also not do anything else.

By owning things, we are telling ourselves - "this is mine", "I want to do this as good as possible because this lets people know my identity", "I bring my talents to the task at hand and do it with utmost attention and care". Only by owning things, we can gain focus, we can gain confidence and we remain committed. Own things up. It is not somebody else's responsibility for it, but yours. Develop that attitude.
