Beautiful words from [here](https://medium.com/javarevisited/the-right-way-to-leetcode-4d70d6aff524):

> "So you have started preparing but for what? Why are you putting so much effort? What is your end goal? If you haven't asked yourself these questions it's probably time for you to step back and think through this first, there is no preparation in the world without an end goal. Without the goal, you won't be consistent, you won't be motivated and most importantly you won't enjoy your progress and oh my friend there is no greater feeling than seeing yourself one step closer to your goal / accomplishing your goal!"
